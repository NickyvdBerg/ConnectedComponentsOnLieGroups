# Image Analysis Applications of Connected Components on Lie Groups in SE(2) in Mathematica

Install the LieAnalysis-package and add it to the right folder:

Download the LieAnalysis-package via [www.LieAnalysis.nl](http://www.lieanalysis.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/LieAnalysis-25-04-2018.zip)

and put it in the folder `C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Applications`. 
Note that your folder path will be slightly different.

Now, you can run the Mathematica notebooks (made in Mathematica 13.3).
